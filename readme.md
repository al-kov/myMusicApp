#MUSICAL MOOD SELECTOR

## Description
Each user creates a personal profile by selecting his or her present mood.. They then select music genre choice. From a list of available songs that includes song title, artist, album name, duration, genre,and  mood types, a personalized playlist displays on its own page. The user has the option to change playlist options at any time.




####Challenges

- Managing data and array organization.
- First project ever using Javascript and jQuery.
- Learning how to model the data in a way that would prove to be helpful.
